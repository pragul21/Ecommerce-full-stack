<h1>Ecommerce project</h1>
<div>=> Starting the thought note with folders info and working flow of project.

* I have created two folders backend and frontend and followed the standard structure for both frontend and backend.

* I have work on functonalities more than how it looks and its responsiveness, i've just  made it responsive to look okish did't waste time on that.

=>WorkFLow

* First sign up for new user or you can SEED user with postman ('/seeduser') this is api for seeeding normal user.

* And for admin user the seed api is ('/seedadmin') and if you want to make normal user admin you need to do it manually form database.

* You can update the users info but you can't change email as i have used email as key to update info.
thats if for signup and use route

* To create or upload new product you can seed 10 products ('/seedproducts') this is the api for that it is protected route.

* And to add product you need to go on seller myproducts page there you can see add product button at bottom.

* OR simply you can create products but keep size of picture under 1mb You can delete and update that product from product Details page to get into product details page you need to click on image of product card And you can submit reviews from products details page only.

* You can search for productName in search bar but you need to refresh it to make it disappear. 

* for orders first the cart products will create a order in cart model so that you can preview it and then finally you can order or edit that cart model and create new order,when you create new order the cart model will be deleted for that user and one user can only have 1 cart model but can have multiple order models.
thats it....

* And i have not added payment gateway but you need to clickon button Pay now at preview order to make the payment status to completed from pending as you can only complete order placement after making the order payment as completed. 

=>it took me more than a month to complete this project but after doing this i am feeling much more confident on building projects ....
